QUERY: medium’s rules and conventions. Contestants on game shows or guests appearing on interview programs (whether The Oprah Winfrey Show [1984–2011] or The O’Reilly Factor [1996–2017])13 are screened before the show; those unsuited for television’s needs (based on visual interest, verbal skill, suitability to a particular topic) are filtered out early. Once the cameras are on, these social actors are permitted to speak “in their own words.” However, the framing questions are Carey’s, Winfrey’s, and O’Reilly’s; the rhythm of the show is strictly controlled by the hosts;

regard, the host is a much more powerful figure than either the anchor or the sports announcer .  For hosts can totally and directly control the behavior of social actors participating in the game  (stand here, answer this question, leave the stage), while anchors and sports announcers can  only interpret and partially shape (through interviewing techniques, editing, etc.) that behavior  in the historical world. The hosts, moreover , know all of the answers to the questions they pose—  whether it’s the price of a toaster oven or the 14th president of the U.S. Even the most skillful  news interviewer is not as all- knowing. Game shows bring together components from reality with those of telev ...

show, guides us in and out of commercial breaks, and bids us farewell at the end. The address  of the game show becomes more complicated than that of the news program, however . During  most of the game show, the host does not speak directly to us, but instead addresses directly  the contestants— as when Alex Trebek poses an “answer” to contestants on Jeopardy! (1964–75,  1978–79, 1984–). At this point, the game show’s address resembles that of narrative, where we  are generally not acknowledged. It’s thus unlike news or sports, which acknowledge and speak  toward the viewer . In game shows, host and contestants speak to one another without noticing  us; in narrative programs, characters do  ...

and the final edit belongs to the producer . Even more than talk shows, game shows rigidly limit  improvisation by situating the social actor within a tightly structured competition. Hypothetically, there are many ways that television people could interact with social actors.  They could touch one another or write letters or gesture with their hands. But, of course, the  principal form this interaction takes is speech, dialogue, conversation— in short, interviewing.  And it is in the interview that we may locate the rudimentary logic of the participatory text.  Where the expository text is governed by the logic of the argument and gathering evidence,  the participatory text’s logic is largel ...
